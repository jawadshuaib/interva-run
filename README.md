High intensity interval training markedly improves both aerobic and anaerobic fitness. This app helps plan and execute an HIIT workout session.

I was originally planning to integrate this with heartrate data from Fitbit. But Fitbit does not currently provide streaming data for heartrate. I have, nonetheless, built a Fitbit API to help faciliate integration between the two in the future. If you are interested, check out my other repo: https://github.com/jawadshuaib/fitbit-api

## Try it out
